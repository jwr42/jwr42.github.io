## Bio

I'm an Operations Executive at a leading Data Science training provider based in London, UK. I develop automated reporting tools to support learners complete their courses.

In my previous role I taught virtual and in-person workshop sessions on data structures, statistics, hypothesis testing, Python programming, machine learning methods, predictive modelling, git version control, and data visualisation (in Tableau, Power BI, & Python). 

I was awarded a First Class Honours for my BSc degree in Theoretical and Computational Physics from Cardiff University in 2018 and a Distinction for my MRes degree in Biomedical Research (epidemiology stream) from Imperial College London in 2020.

On this site I keep a few of my personal projects that I work on in my spare time. If you would like to get in touch with me please feel free to use any of the links provided to reach out.
