## Bio

I'm an Operations Executive at a leading data training provider based in London, UK. My role is currently split between internal reporting to senior managers and custom external reporting for larger clients. In previous roles I led the training of data analysts from one of UK's largest retailers and organised data hackathon events. I have experience teaching sessions on a variety of data topics including introductory statistics, hypothesis testing, machine learning methods, predictive modelling methods, data governance, git version control, and data visualisation (in Tableau, Power BI, & Python). I was awarded a First Class Honours for my BSc degree in Theoretical and Computational Physics from Cardiff University in 2018 and a Distinction for my MRes degree in Biomedical Research (epidemiology stream) from Imperial College London in 2020.

On this site I keep a few of my personal projects that I work on in my spare time. If you would like to get in touch with me please feel free to use any of the links provided to reach out.
