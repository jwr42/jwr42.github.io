# Using an API to build a daylight time dashboard in Python

This project aimed to build a simple dashboard using the [sunrisesunset.io](https://sunrisesunset.io/api/) API to provide a quick summary of when sunrise and sunset will occur in various cities across the UK. It makes use of a few Shinylive app features such as the ipyleaflet map, so the user can quickly identify which city they've selected in the sidebar.

## Features

-   Using an API to pull the data for the the selected location.
-   Filters in the sidebar to select city and date.
-   Darkmode toggle switch.
-   ipyleaflet map to visualise the chosen city's location.
